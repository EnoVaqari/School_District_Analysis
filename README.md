# School District Analysis


## Purpose

The school board suspects that data regarding the grades of math and reading of ninth grade of Thomas High School may have been changed. We should remove the data and perform the analysis again for comparison.

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?

Original District Summary:

Adjusted District Summary:

While comparing the Original District Summary with the Adjusted District Summary, we can see that the Average Math score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading , and % Overall Passing decrease slightly by less than 0.5%.


* How is the school summary affected?

Original School Summary (Thomas High School):

Adjusted School Summary (Thomas High school):

By removing 9th graders in the Adjusted School Summary, the percentages of Passing Math and Passing Reading drop. In addition, the Overall Passing percentage dropped significantly from 90% to 65% after removing the 9th graders.


* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Adjusted:

Replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores has a direct affect only for the performance of Thomas High School. The replacement does not affect the Overall Passing for other schools.



* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:


1. Math and reading scores by grade

Math Score by Grade:

Reading Score by Grade:

Exlucing the 9th grades causes minor percantage changes, which are not identifiable when rounding up to a whole number.


2. Scores by school spending

Original Scores by School Spending:

Adjusted Scores by School Spending:

Scores by school spending

After excluding the ninth graders’ math and reading scores from the performance of Thomas High School, there is a noted decrease in % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing in the spending range of $630-$644.



1. Scores by school size

Original Scores By School Size:

Adjusted Scores By School Size:

Excluding 9th graders' math and reading scores from Thomas High School has slight impact in score by school size, which is not visible when the percentages are rounded up.



1. Scores by school type


Original Scores by school type:

Adjusted Scores by school type:

Excluding the 9th graders' scores has no impact based on school type.


### Summary

Four major changes noted in the analysis are the following:

The Overall Passing rate for Thomas High School dropped from 91% to 65%, when removing 9th graders' scores.

The % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and the % Overall Passing in the school spending range of $630-$644 decrease notably.

The percentages and scores change with 0.5% between the Original versus Adjusted District Summary.

Lastely, there are slight impacts on math in Thomas High School when removing 9th graders in the overall math and reading scores and the school size analysis; however, when rounding up these percantage differences are not noticable.
